Trip-Trekker ensures a comprehensive travel planning experience, addressing various user needs like city tours, traffic conditions, speed adjustments, and activity planning.
Below is a brief overview of each algorithm used:
Travelling Salesman Problem Branch and Bound - The Travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It involves finding the shortest possible route that can be taken to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city with the minimum cost. 
Dijkstra algorithm - Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph. 
Activity Time Scheduling - Using Greedy Algorithm, to select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap in time.
